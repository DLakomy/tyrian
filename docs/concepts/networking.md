Out of the box, Tyrian supports two flavors of networking, [HTTP and Web Sockets](https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/tyrian/tree/main/examples), and we have examples you can run of both. Please see the instructions in the README file.

It should be said that both implementations are quite primitive at the time of writing. Contributions in the form of issues and improvements are very welcome in this area. No doubt the will be improved as the need arises.
