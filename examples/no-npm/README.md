# Tyrian counter example - No NPM Version!

This is yet another version of the Counter example, but this one is just plain old HTML + JavaScript. No NPM, no bundlers, nothing.

You will need a static http server unfortunately, you can install one globally with ...npm (there are others, I like this one):

```npm install -g http-server```

To run your http server, `cd` into this directory (`tyrian/examples/no-npm`) using your terminal, and then run:

```http-server -c-1```

Then navigate to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) in your browser of choice.
